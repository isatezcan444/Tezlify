# Tezlify — production ops, deploy state, verification

Detail moved out of `MEMORY.md` to keep that index inside its injection limit. Read this when you are
about to touch production, deploy, or run the test suites. Invariants live in
`whatsapp-subsystem-invariants.md`; narratives live in `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Production topology & access

- Oracle `130.162.247.20`, `/opt/tezlify`, user `ubuntu`, SSH key `~/.ssh/id_tezlify_oracle`.
  **Push is not deploy.** Compose file `docker-compose.prod.yml`; services `backend`, `gateway`, `db`,
  `caddy`.
- Gateway listens on **8787** (`GATEWAY_PORT`) and its container has **no `curl`** — query it with `node`
  inside the container reading `process.env.WHATSAPP_GATEWAY_SECRET`, so the secret never leaves its own
  environment. **Gateway REST auth is `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`** — NOT `X-Gateway-Secret`, which
  is the inbound `/ws/gateway` side.
- `GET /sessions/:sid/conversations?limit=500` returns `{ items, total }` (not `conversations`/`chats`).
- **Production is PostgreSQL, not SQLite.** `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tezlify:...@db:5432/tezlify`; the
  repo-root `tezlify.db` is stale and `sqlite3` is absent on the host. Use
  `docker exec tezlify-db psql -U tezlify -d tezlify`.
  - `history_sync_states` is keyed `(session_id, jid)` — joining on `jid` alone multiplies rows and
    inflates `count(m.id)`.
  - `conversations` has **no `jid` column**; join `contacts` for `display_name`.
  - In `\pset format unaligned`, a top-level `SELECT` prints the header **once per column** — wrap it in
    a CTE to get one line per row.
- **`WHATSAPP_AUTO_RESTORE=false`**: a gateway restart does **not** re-attach the linked line.
  `POST /sessions/restore` (gateway, `X-Gateway-Secret`, no body) re-attaches from persisted creds with
  **no QR**. `listRestorableSessions()` only returns sessions active in both `gateway_sessions` and
  `whatsapp_sessions` with stored credentials — check that count before firing it.
- Local sandbox sets `HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:59508`, which tunnels `app.tezlify.com`
  into a 502 — run API probes **from the production host** (Caddy is local there). Playwright exists only
  in the repo `venv` (`venv/bin/python`).
- **Nested `sh -c "… node -e \"…\""` quoting does not survive ssh.** Write the script to `/tmp` and
  `docker cp` it in. A heredoc `<<'JS'` is fine, but `${...}` template literals are still expanded by the
  **local** shell — use string concatenation instead. After `--force-recreate` a container loses its
  `/tmp`, so `docker cp` must be repeated.

## Production browser probes

Procedure in the `real-browser-cdp-verification` skill. Short form:
`scripts/auth_helper.get_ephemeral_auth_token()` (2-hour `auth_staging_sessions` row for user
`f65642ab-...`) + real Chrome with `--host-resolver-rules=MAP app.tezlify.com 130.162.247.20`. The app is
tab-based, not routed: enter via `button[data-tab-id="whatsapp"]`; conversation rows are
`button[data-conv-id]`. Count `ChatThread` instances name-independently by walking the fiber tree from
the `__reactContainer$` root and matching `memoizedProps.messages` + `leadName` — minified names change
per build.

## Frontend release mechanics

- Releases live at `/opt/tezlify/releases/` (NOT `/opt/tezlify/frontend/releases/` — that older path
  exists but is unused by the symlinks). Swap the `frontend_candidate` symlink atomically
  (`ln -sfn` + `mv -T`) then **force-recreate Caddy** (its bind mount resolves the symlink at creation).
- Cache policy is already right: entry document `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`, hashed assets
  `immutable, max-age=31536000` — a plain reload picks up a deploy; no hard refresh needed.
- Release dirs are **build output only** (`index.html` + `assets/`, ~960 KB): no `node_modules`, no git
  repo on the host, so build locally and upload with `rsync`.
- `frontend/package-lock.json` does **not** exist -> `npm ci` is impossible; use `npm install` / existing
  `node_modules`. `.env.production` and `.env.local` both blank `VITE_API_URL`, but production always
  resolves same-origin `/api/v1` (`resolveApiBase()` short-circuits on `isRemoteHost`).
- Vite's `prepareOutDir` calls `emptyDir` on `dist/assets`; the sandbox's bulk-delete guard (>50 files)
  makes that fail and it *looks* like a build error. `rm -rf dist` first.

## Deploy state (2026-09-26)

- Prod `/opt/tezlify` is a **git checkout deliberately left dirty** at `359fe6d` with the deployed patches
  applied as uncommitted working-tree changes. **That dirt is the deploy marker** — never run
  `git checkout .` / `git reset --hard` / `git clean` there. A later full deploy of `ddbfbf4` should find
  those files already matching.
- Live: frontend `5916ff1` chat-thread singleton + `8177a2b` i18n missing keys; backend `9981298`
  502-on-short-conversation + `6c7214a` ~4 s open-path bound; naming fix
  `55f994e`/`1030850`/`4bd7791`; gateway `4fc791a` chat-ordering stamp. Restarts are routine and the line
  re-attaches via `POST /sessions/restore` (no QR) — proven again 2026-09-26 09:21 (`restored:1`,
  CONNECTED, +905413749073).
- **Frontend release handle:** `frontend_candidate` -> `releases/v20260926_i18n_missing_keys` (live bundle
  `index-y-X3DlGp.js`, sha256 `52cead01…`); rollback target `v20260926_phase6_8_chatthread_singleton`
  (`index-3UEtgr4K.js`).
- **Residual, by design:** 19 zero-row conversations still 502 (17 no evidence row, 4 NOT_CHECKED,
  2 NO_MESSAGES; `is_history_exhausted_or_stalled` does not treat `NO_MESSAGES` as exhausted). All stale
  (newest 2026-08-27, oldest 2026-03-24) and none in the top 8 by recency.
- `ddbfbf4`'s large `session-manager.js` (+299) / `socket-events.js` (+105) rewrite remains **undeployed**
  by explicit choice. Prod's `socket-events.js` has no `selfJid` block in its connect handler, so patches
  authored against `ddbfbf4`'s shape do not apply there.
- **A line re-link without history purges message history.** A new `whatsapp_sessions` row created at
  09:34:56 on 2026-09-26 (id 86, the user's own number `+905413749073`) rebuilt all 113 conversation rows
  and dropped `messages` 529 → 44. Not a code bug — a re-link — but it invalidates any before/after
  comparison across that timestamp.

## Verification baselines

- Last run (2026-09-26): backend **1169 pass / 4 skip / 0 fail**; gateway all **8** `npm test` scripts
  pass (`test-system-content-preview.mjs` 14 checks, `test-contact-cache.mjs` 37,
  `test-contact-hydration.mjs` 26); frontend `verify:logic` **45/45** (incl. the two i18n checks),
  `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` exit 0.
- **`verify:pairing` fails 2 checks with and without recent changes** (`calls=0`, `cancel=0`) — a harness
  failure, not a product one (confirmed by stashing). Do not attribute it to your change.
- Never run pytest on dev `tezlify.db` (or a **data** copy). Build the test DB **schema-only**:
  `sqlite3 tezlify.db .schema > s.sql && sqlite3 /tmp/empty.db < s.sql` -> 22 tables, 0 rows, including
  the raw-SQL tables (`history_sync_states`, `lid_mappings`, `auth_staging_*`) that bare
  `Base.metadata.create_all` misses (it yields only 16). Some modules assert **global** row counts
  (`test_whatsapp_faz9_group_phone_banner.py`), so foreign WhatsApp data fails them for reasons unrelated
  to the change — re-run against an empty schema before blaming code. Fresh pytest basetemp.
- `Scoutify` is a **symlink to `Tezlify`** — pytest tracebacks printing `../Scoutify/backend/...` are the
  same files.
- Compare actual exit codes (piping through `tail`/`head` masks them). **Falsify before trusting:** stash
  the source fix (`git stash push -- <path>`), require the new test to fail on the *precise* assertion,
  then restore. Counter-only assertions can pass under a missing call site, and post-reset counters need
  an explicit baseline, never zero.
- **Parallel `Edit` calls on one file clobber each other** — three concurrent edits to `MEMORY.md` landed
  only the first. Edit the same file sequentially, or rewrite it with one `Write`.
